            About Me
        </h3>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm an enthusiastic problem solver with a passion for building structures and turning designs into a reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            I take personal development seriously, and I don't hesitate to explore new software and solutions that will help me reach my goals. 
            In my pursuit of knowledge, I've learned how to use Godot and GDScript, HTML and CSS, JavaScript, and NextJS. 
            In addition, I study interesting concepts along the way such as the advantages and pitfalls of object-oriented programming, or how to improve the accuracy of AI image recognition.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also believe in enriching life through hobbies outside of my field of study. 
            In my free time, some of the activities I enjoy are fast paced collaborative games, relaxing with open-world exploration games, or reading the latest mystery-thriller-fantasy novel.
        </p>

        <p>
            This project is being built in Godot, a game engine especially suited for solo or independent game developers. 
            The engine excels in designing code with modular, reusable, node-based structure, which has helped hone my abilities in writing organized, cohesive, and clean code.
