                                <p>Kart Drive is a 3D driving simulation produced through a college course that guided each student to build our own game from scratch - from creating 3D assets and animations in Maya, sourcing royalty-free music and creating sound effects, to programming useful game elements in Unity. This experience was a welcome first taste of what professional game development looked like, and turned the hodgepodge of self-taught skills I had learned over the 4 years prior into a dependable repertoire.</p>

                                <p>The course used a modular approach which demonstrated an easy way to test and add new features, and had an emphasis on prototyping before getting into details. This manifested as a barebones testing environment with a box on wheels driving around a flat plane with obstacles of basic geometry, scattered collectibles, and easily accessible win/lose zones. It was only after coding and testing each key game feature that the exported Maya models and visual effects were added.</p>

                                <p>The goal I had with working on Go Pepper Grow was to refine my game development skills and understand my strengths, weaknesses, and passions in the pipeline outside of coding and problem solving. It's a project I open up when there's a concept I want to explore, so there's a variety of techniques on display. So far, I have noticed a lack of drive for asset creation but a fascination with design and planning, and I've come to the conclusion that I would really enjoy working on a team where everyone can focus on their strengths to build a great product.</p>

                                <p>As for the project itself, Go Pepper Grow is a fantasy RPG with an uncommon take on player controls. I drew inspiration from Rune Factory 4 with its balance between farming and combat, and Maplestory with its keyboard-based minigames. The player controls I wanted to implement are using directions to interact with the world; for example, when the player wants to shake a berry bush, a left-right sequence to mimic shaking a bush is randomly generated for the player to follow. <a class="link" href="https://github.com/ares-yng/Go-Pepper-Grow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go Pepper Grow</a> can be found on my GitHub, alongside a <a class="link" href="https://github.com/ares-yng/Go-Pepper-Grow/blob/main/Go%20Pepper%20Grow%20-%20GDD.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">game design document</a> with compact details on systems and design choices.</p>

                                <h2>Creating Farming</h2>
                                <p>In this video, I am demonstrating the farming system which allows the player to plant and obtain crops. To get it working, I started with a gameplan on how I wanted the system to function. What would be the conditions for a crop to grow? Did I want crops to be regrowing? If so, how would regrowth happen? What happens after a crop is harvested? By asking and answering these questions, I detailed the implementation of each distinct concept into pseudocode and diagrams. For example, the "down-right-right" harvesting sequence was randomly generated according to parameters that are able be unique to each plant - such as a carrot that is plucked using up and down inputs. This type of work is my favorite part of game development and coding in general, and I'm always motivated when it comes up.</p>

                                <p>Aside from farming, other systems I wanted to challenge were dialogue, combat, and save files. The main question was how I would handle data storage and management, which I decided to tackle using a database called SQLite. I was unfamiliar with using a database, but I had some help getting started and went through many iterations to refine what I wanted to do and how I could do it. The current implementation involves two databases. One has static parameters such as enemy health and behavior, dialogue lines, and default values. The other contains dynamic data such as the player's position and belongings. Organization makes a big difference in streamlining the development process, as it is easier to edit similar features and add content without needing to do additional programming.</p>

                                <p>This project is being developed in Godot, a game engine that specializes in a composition-based coding paradigm where everything is built with nodes. Godot provides a variety of base nodes that can be combined with other nodes and scripts to create individualized nodes, which can then be used to form scenes (which can also be used as nodes themselves) and the entire project. My experience with Godot has enhanced my ability to design reusable, organized code.</p>

                                <p>For this webpage, I began by listing key features and drafting a layout of what it could look like as the user scrolled through each section. This took place in basic programs like MS Paint and Notepad. My first mockup included a navigation bar, section titles, and basic content. I planned for everything to be on a single page since I was working with GitHub's free website, so I chose a layout that used scrolling to display each section.</p>

                                <p>On my second iteration, I wanted to improve the overall look and make the sections more distinct from each other. I settled on a landing that extended through the entire page for a cohesive, iconic look, and displaying each section in separate cards.</p>
                                <p>As I implemented the design, I realized the album format was impractical and overly complicated, so I changed it to display each image and caption in a linear format instead. I also decided to add sections that are permanently visible rather than having everything be hidden, which gives the page more variety and readability.</p>

                                <p>I participated in a small online gaming tournament where one of the key features of the tournament relied on a manual countdown to facilitate synchronization between teams. Since there was a limited staff, I wanted to help simplify the processes by providing an automated countdown. With my bot, a tournament organizer would have the ability to start the countdown when they were ready to proceed, but the bot would handle communications with the teams and allow the tournament organizer to focus on their main task such as commentating on stream.</p>

                                <p>It's important to provide users with the knowledge to pilot features. One feature allows a tournament organizer to set the channels where the bot should send announcements. I supplied the command format, a description, feedback on which channels are set, and supplementary instructions in case the user isn't familiar with retrieving channel IDs.</p>

                                <p>This is the second discord bot I've created, with the first being in 2019 having a similar purpose but different impact. I enjoy giving back to the communities I'm in, so I jumped at the opportunity when I saw it. One question that was raised during creation was if the bot could be hosted permanently, so I researched and found two options: locally hosting on a PC or finding a service. I tested various online services, including Vercel, Cloudflare, Replit, Oracle Cloud, CodeSandbox, and Heroku, but decided that hosting locally made the most sense for the scope of this project.</p>
